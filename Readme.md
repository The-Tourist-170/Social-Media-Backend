Hi there, I'm ***Ayushya Saxena*** 👋
***Full-Stack Developer | Building Intelligent Web Applications with React, Spring Boot, and AI***
I'm a passionate and driven Computer Science graduate with a love for building things that live on the internet. My focus is on full-stack development, where I enjoy the challenge of architecting robust backend systems with Java & Spring Boot and creating beautiful, responsive user interfaces with React.js.

What truly excites me is the intersection of software development and artificial intelligence. I heavily leverage AI in my projects—like building an AI-powered search for my NetflixGPT clone or developing AI email categorization for OneBox—to create smarter, more intuitive applications.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on OneBox, an email aggregator with AI-powered features.

- 🌱 I’m always learning and exploring new ways to implement AI in practical, real-world scenarios.
